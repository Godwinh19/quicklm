We're working at this moment with 2 data source
- ALFA_PUBLIC from [here](https://github.com/getalp/ALFFA_PUBLIC/blob/master/ASR/FONGBE/LM/fongbe.txt)
- Bible from [jw website](https://www.jw.org/fon/nus%C9%9Bxwet%C9%9Bn/biblu/)

We perform some processing with the second one in the `process_bible_epub.py`
